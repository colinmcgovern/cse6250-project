# CSE/OAN 6250 Reproducibility Challenge Team G4

## Description
This effort is an attempt to reproduce the results found in the paper “Knowledge-aware Assessment of Severity of Suicide Risk for Early Intervention.”[^1] This effort will compare the peformance of a 5-label convolutional neural network to assess the risk of suicide sourced from Reddit posts. It will be compared to to three, four, and five-label models utilizing support vector machine, random forest, and feed-forward neural network.
